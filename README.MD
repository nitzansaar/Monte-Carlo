# Monte Carlo Approach, Word Frequency Analysis, and Breast Cancer Data Analysis

This project consists of three Python scripts that cover various topics: Monte Carlo simulation for a dice game called "Approach", word frequency analysis using command-line arguments, and analysis of breast cancer data using the `pandas` library.

## Monte Carlo Approach

The `MonteCarlo.py` script simulates the dice game "Approach" using a Monte Carlo approach to estimate the probability of winning with different "hold" values. The script estimates the best value to hold at by simulating games for various hold values and counting the winning occurrences.

## Word Frequency Analysis

The `wc.py` script performs word frequency analysis on text files. It accepts command-line arguments to specify file inputs, processing options, and output methods. It counts the frequency of each word in the input files and provides the option to sort the results by frequency.

## Breast Cancer Data Analysis

The `pandasExercise.py` script utilizes the `pandas` library to analyze breast cancer data. It reads data from a CSV file, performs various analyses, and visualizes the results using matplotlib. The script explores common classifications, the most common age and menopause status among patients with recurrence, and plots the number of recurrences per age group.

## What I Learned

Through this project, I acquired several skills and concepts:

- **Monte Carlo Simulation**: Implemented a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate probabilities in a game scenario, similar to the Approach dice game.
- **Python Scripting**: Developed Python scripts to automate tasks and analyze data, demonstrating proficiency in various libraries, including `random`, `collections`, `os`, `argparse`, `pandas`, and `matplotlib`.
- **Command-Line Arguments**: Utilized the `argparse` library to parse command-line arguments for different scripts, enhancing their flexibility and customization.
- **Data Analysis**: Conducted word frequency analysis and data analysis on breast cancer data, showcasing the ability to extract insights and patterns from raw data.
- **Data Visualization**: Created visualizations using matplotlib to present findings clearly and effectively.
- **Pandas Usage**: Utilized the `pandas` library to read, process, and analyze structured data from CSV files, including filtering, aggregation, and visualization.
- **Problem Solving**: Addressed various problem domains, from probabilistic simulations to data analysis, demonstrating a versatile skill set.

Overall, this project allowed me to gain practical experience in simulation-based analysis, data processing, and visualization, contributing to a well-rounded understanding of Python programming and data manipulation.
